Dart Playground
===============

This is a repo where I keep experimental Dart code while in the process of learning Dart. If you have any suggestions or remarks, feel free to send them.

Examples
--------

* **Twitter Search Simple**: allows you to search for a keyword on Twitter. The results are shown in a table that is dynamically updated. This example contains code that queries and manipulates the DOM, invokes the Twitter JSON(P) API and parses the incoming JSON data.

* **Twitter Search Simple with Web Components**: this is basically the same example as Twitter Search Simple, but uses Web Components with data binding and templating.

* **Twitter Search**: allows you to search for keywords on Twitter. It keeps a list of previous searches. This examples uses Web Components with templating and data binding.
